they are times have broken down and got back up again, also tring to figure out life in a new
country with my family, like having to go back to high school and all getting a job it all looking
like a hard mountain  to climb, but now it all a story now am in my dream college here in canada in janurey 6<sup>th</sup> and all things 
are looking so good now , that saying <em>"trust the process"</em> they say is indeed true. The quote that makes
    me stay motivated is <cite>'Don't give up on yourself,the moment you think about quitting, remember why you started"</cite>
